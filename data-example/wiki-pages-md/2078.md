Minigames
[![](/images/thumb/Minigames.png/120px-Minigames.png?d639f)](/w/File:Minigames.png)




**Minigames** are small games in which players (or a team of players) set out to complete a certain objective. These games usually allow players to gain [experience](/w/Experience "Experience") and/or [items](/w/Items "Items"). They are identified with a red star [![](/images/Minigame_map_icon.png?87d99)](/w/File:Minigame_map_icon.png) [icon](/w/Icon "Icon") on the [world map](/w/World_map "World map"). Minigames can be repeated, unlike [quests](/w/Quests "Quests") or [miniquests](/w/Miniquest "Miniquest") which can only be completed once. There are four [free-to-play](/w/Free-to-play "Free-to-play") minigames, which are all notably [PvP](/w/PvP "PvP") minigames: [Emir's Arena](/w/Emir%27s_Arena "Emir's Arena"), [Clan Wars](/w/Clan_Wars "Clan Wars"), [Castle Wars](/w/Castle_Wars "Castle Wars"), and [Last Man Standing](/w/Last_Man_Standing "Last Man Standing").

## Grouping interface[[edit](/w/Minigames?section=1&veaction=edit "Edit section: Grouping interface") | [edit source](/w/Minigames?action=edit&section=1 "Edit section's source code: Grouping interface")]


[![](/images/Grouping.png?31abc)](/w/File:Grouping.png)

The Grouping interface.


Main article: [Grouping](/w/Grouping "Grouping")
The [Grouping](/w/Grouping "Grouping") interface can be found under the [chat-channel](/w/Chat-channel "Chat-channel") tab. Select the desired [minigame](/w/Minigame "Minigame") from the drop down menu and players will be entered into a chat channel to help you find other players. Players cannot be in two chat channels at the same time, so joining the minigame chat channel will automatically remove you from any channel you were previously in. 


The Grouping interface can also [teleport](/w/Teleport "Teleport") you to the minigames location (provided you meet the requirements to access it). This teleport does not use the same cooldown timer (20 minutes) as the home teleport spell and **cannot** be cast from [PvP worlds](/w/PvP_world "PvP world"), the [Wilderness](/w/Wilderness "Wilderness"), or the [Emir's Arena](/w/Emir%27s_Arena "Emir's Arena").



## Minigames[[edit](/w/Minigames?section=2&veaction=edit "Edit section: Minigames") | [edit source](/w/Minigames?action=edit&section=2 "Edit section's source code: Minigames")]


Minigames are classified as either Safe or Dangerous depending on whether items are or are not kept on death, or are moved to a [grave](/w/Grave "Grave") or [IRS](/w/Item_Retrieval_Service "Item Retrieval Service").



### Safe[[edit](/w/Minigames?section=3&veaction=edit "Edit section: Safe") | [edit source](/w/Minigames?action=edit&section=3 "Edit section's source code: Safe")]


There are two types of safe minigames: safe combat and no combat. Minigames with safe combat will see players fight monsters or other players, and if/when they die, they will respawn in a designated area in the minigame **with all their items**. Minigames with no combat have no monsters or player-versus-player areas, so **players cannot be killed** - however, if players are poisoned outside the minigame area, and then do not cure themselves when entering the area, they can still die from the poison. The latter can be a problem if the minigame is [instanced](/w/Instance "Instance") and you've manually dropped items on the floor. Warning: [Hardcore Group Ironmen](/w/Group_Ironman_Mode "Group Ironman Mode") will **always** lose a life in PvM activities labelled as safe deaths.



### Dangerous[[edit](/w/Minigames?section=4&veaction=edit "Edit section: Dangerous") | [edit source](/w/Minigames?action=edit&section=4 "Edit section's source code: Dangerous")]


Items will be moved to a [grave](/w/Grave "Grave") or [IRS](/w/Item_Retrieval_Service "Item Retrieval Service") upon death. Regular death mechanics will apply. You will have 15 minutes to get your items back from a grave after which they will be transferred to [Death's Office](/w/Death%27s_Office "Death's Office"). To get your items back you will have to pay a fee, but ironmen get a 50% discount. Dangerous deaths also imply [Hardcore ironmen](/w/Hardcore_ironmen "Hardcore ironmen") lose their status.



## Combat minigames[[edit](/w/Minigames?section=5&veaction=edit "Edit section: Combat minigames") | [edit source](/w/Minigames?action=edit&section=5 "Edit section's source code: Combat minigames")]


These minigames involve the use of combat skills to fight players or monsters.
