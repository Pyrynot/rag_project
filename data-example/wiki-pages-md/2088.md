## Introduction[[edit](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?section=2&veaction=edit "Edit section: Introduction") | [edit source](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?action=edit&section=2 "Edit section's source code: Introduction")]


The quest is one of the first quests completed by new players, and is intended to encourage the player to explore the town of [Lumbridge](/w/Lumbridge "Lumbridge"). Note, however, that you can skip the collection process by simply bringing a [pot of flour](/w/Pot_of_flour "Pot of flour"), a [bucket of milk](/w/Bucket_of_milk "Bucket of milk"), and an [egg](/w/Egg "Egg") with you before starting the quest; all items are tradeable, and can be purchased on the [Grand Exchange](/w/Grand_Exchange "Grand Exchange"). When speaking with the cook with all of these items in your inventory, you will say that you happen to have those items with you, and the cook will ask if you were planning on baking a cake. This will complete the quest in seconds.

### A feast for a Duke[[edit](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?section=4&veaction=edit "Edit section: A feast for a Duke") | [edit source](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?action=edit&section=4 "Edit section's source code: A feast for a Duke")]

The quest start location.


[![](/images/Cook_%28Lumbridge%29_chathead.png?75d24)](/w/File:Cook_(Lumbridge)_chathead.png)




Begin the quest by speaking with the Lumbridge [cook](/w/Cook_(Lumbridge) "Cook (Lumbridge)"), found in the kitchen on the ground floor[UK]1st floor[US] of [Lumbridge Castle](/w/Lumbridge_Castle "Lumbridge Castle"). He mentions it is [Duke Horacio](/w/Duke_Horacio "Duke Horacio")'s birthday and that he is supposed to bake the Duke a [cake](/w/Cake "Cake"). Unfortunately, however, he has forgotten to buy the ingredients, and asks the player to bring him a [bucket of milk](/w/Bucket_of_milk "Bucket of milk"), an [egg](/w/Egg "Egg"), and a [pot of flour](/w/Pot_of_flour "Pot of flour").



#### Bucket and pot[[edit](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?section=5&veaction=edit "Edit section: Bucket and pot") | [edit source](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?action=edit&section=5 "Edit section's source code: Bucket and pot")]


A [bucket](/w/Bucket "Bucket") spawns in the cellar of Lumbridge Castle, and a [pot](/w/Pot "Pot") spawns in the kitchen on the centre table. You can also purchase both a bucket and a pot from the [Lumbridge General Store](/w/Lumbridge_General_Store "Lumbridge General Store"), for 2 and 1 [coins](/w/Coins "Coins"), respectively.


If you are a [member](/w/Member "Member"), it is recommended to grab a second pot before moving on to the next step, as you will need a second pot of flour for a [diary task](/w/Achievement_Diary "Achievement Diary").



#### Egg[[edit](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?section=6&veaction=edit "Edit section: Egg") | [edit source](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?action=edit&section=6 "Edit section's source code: Egg")]


[![](/images/thumb/Cook%27s_Assistant_-_Chicken_coop.png/300px-Cook%27s_Assistant_-_Chicken_coop.png?78c13)](/w/File:Cook%27s_Assistant_-_Chicken_coop.png)

The location for an [egg](/w/Egg "Egg"), found in the coop north of [Lumbridge](/w/Lumbridge "Lumbridge").


Go east out of [Lumbridge Castle](/w/Lumbridge_Castle "Lumbridge Castle") and run north along the path until you reach the [chicken](/w/Chicken "Chicken") coop north-west of [Farmer Fred](/w/Farmer_Fred "Farmer Fred")'s house. Go into the coop and pick up an [egg](/w/Egg "Egg").



#### Bucket of milk[[edit](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?section=7&veaction=edit "Edit section: Bucket of milk") | [edit source](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?action=edit&section=7 "Edit section's source code: Bucket of milk")]


[![](/images/thumb/Cook%27s_Assistant_-_Dairy_cow.png/300px-Cook%27s_Assistant_-_Dairy_cow.png?fe2c3)](/w/File:Cook%27s_Assistant_-_Dairy_cow.png)

Milking a [dairy cow](/w/Dairy_cow "Dairy cow").


With an empty [bucket](/w/Bucket "Bucket"), go north into the [cow](/w/Cow "Cow") pasture. Use the empty bucket on a [dairy cow](/w/Dairy_cow "Dairy cow") to get a [bucket of milk](/w/Bucket_of_milk "Bucket of milk"). You can optionally talk to [Gillie Groats](/w/Gillie_Groats "Gillie Groats") for an explanation on how to milk a cow. She can be found across the [river](/w/River_Lum "River Lum"), next to the dairy cow in the eastern [Lumbridge cow field](/w/Lumbridge_cow_field "Lumbridge cow field").



#### Pot of flour[[edit](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?section=8&veaction=edit "Edit section: Pot of flour") | [edit source](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?action=edit&section=8 "Edit section's source code: Pot of flour")]


With an empty [pot](/w/Pot "Pot"), leave the cow pasture and go south-west to the wheat field. Pick some [grain](/w/Grain "Grain"), and then enter the [Mill Lane Mill](/w/Mill_Lane_Mill "Mill Lane Mill"), found up the road to the north-east. Climb to the top floor, put the grain in the hopper, then pull the lever and climb back down to the ground floor[UK]1st floor[US]. Finally, use an empty [pot](/w/Pot "Pot") on the [flour bin](/w/Flour_bin "Flour bin") (which is now full of flour) to get a [pot of flour](/w/Pot_of_flour "Pot of flour"). You can optionally talk to [Millie Miller](/w/Millie_Miller "Millie Miller") inside the mill for an explanation on how to make [flour](/w/Pot_of_flour "Pot of flour").


If you are a [member](/w/Member "Member"), the [easy Lumbridge & Draynor Diary](/w/Easy_Lumbridge_%26_Draynor_Diary "Easy Lumbridge & Draynor Diary") requires baking [bread](/w/Bread "Bread") on the Lumbridge Castle [range](/w/Cooking_range_(Lumbridge_Castle) "Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)"). Since this requires obtaining another pot of flour for [bread dough](/w/Bread_dough "Bread dough"), you can save time by obtaining a second pot of flour now (requiring more grain). You will need to repeat the milling process for each bucket of flour you make.



### Delivery[[edit](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?section=9&veaction=edit "Edit section: Delivery") | [edit source](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?action=edit&section=9 "Edit section's source code: Delivery")]


After collecting the ingredients, speak to the [cook](/w/Cook_(Lumbridge) "Cook (Lumbridge)") to deliver them.


**Congratulations, quest complete!**

## Trivia[[edit](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?section=13&veaction=edit "Edit section: Trivia") | [edit source](/w/Cook%27s_Assistant?action=edit&section=13 "Edit section's source code: Trivia")]


* There is an [easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media) "wikipedia:Easter egg (media)") in the [Death to the Dorgeshuun](/w/Death_to_the_Dorgeshuun "Death to the Dorgeshuun") quest. When you introduce [Zanik](/w/Zanik "Zanik") to the [Cook](/w/Cook_(Lumbridge) "Cook (Lumbridge)"), he tries to offer the quest to her, saying: "In fact, it's a good thing I met you. It's the Duke's birthday today, and I should be making him a lovely big birthday cake. I need eggs, flour and milk..." The player then tells the Cook that Zanik does not have time for that, to which he responds, "It was worth a try." This insinuates that the cook asks all newcomers to bring him supplies.
* During the [20th Anniversary event](/w/20th_Anniversary_event "20th Anniversary event") it was revealed that the Cook has attempted and failed to bake a cake countless times, explaining his recurring need for ingredients from new adventurers.
* The [Cook](/w/Cook_(servant) "Cook (servant)") at the [Servants' Guild](/w/Servants%27_Guild "Servants' Guild") of [Ardougne](/w/Ardougne "Ardougne") references this quest in her dialogue, saying: *"Overnight I was fired and replaced by some fool who can't even bake a cake without help!"*
