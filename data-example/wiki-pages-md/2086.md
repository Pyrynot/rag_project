ExperienceExperience
**Experience**, commonly abbreviated as **EXP** or **XP**, is a measure of progress for [skills](/w/Skills "Skills"). It is obtained by performing tasks related to that skill. Experience can also be gained through other means, such as [quests](/w/Quests "Quests"), the [book of knowledge](/w/Book_of_knowledge "Book of knowledge") from the [Surprise Exam](/w/Surprise_Exam "Surprise Exam") [random event](/w/Random_event "Random event"), a [lamp](/w/Lamp "Lamp") from the [genie](/w/Genie "Genie") random event, certain [minigames](/w/Minigames "Minigames"), and lamps for completing parts of the [Achievement Diary](/w/Achievement_Diary "Achievement Diary") and [Combat Achievements](/w/Combat_Achievements "Combat Achievements").


After gaining a certain amount of experience, players will advance to the next [level](/w/Level "Level") in that skill, which can result in new abilities, and the chance to try more quests. The amount of experience needed for the next level is approximately 10% more than the last level. For example, 83 experience is required for advancement to level 2, while 91 experience is required for advancement to level 3. Reaching level 99 in a skill requires a total of 13,034,431 experience. By around level 30, the exponential factor predominates, so that the amount of experience required doubles for each 7th level. Accordingly, level 92 is nearly the exact halfway mark to level 99, requiring 6,517,253 experience, and level 85 requires very nearly one quarter of the experience needed for level 99. The "92 is half of 99" rule can be seen visually below.


Experience is stored as a signed integer with 32 bit length, that is treated like a fixed-point number with one decimal place,[[1]](#cite_note-1) although the game does not display decimal values; for example, if a player receives two experience drops of 2.5, the first is shown as 2 and the second as 3 (or vice versa depending on their existing experience points). Experience values that would have multiple decimal points, such as through multiplication with [experience-boosting sets](/w/Experience-boosting_set "Experience-boosting set"), are rounded down to one decimal. The maximum value of a signed integer is 2,147,483,647, treating the ones as the first decimal place, it has a max value of 214,748,364.7, hence the experience that can be obtained in one skill is capped at [200,000,000](/w/200_million_experience "200 million experience"). The skill can still be trained afterwards, but no experience will be received.

### Virtual levels[[edit](/w/Experience?section=3&veaction=edit "Edit section: Virtual levels") | [edit source](/w/Experience?action=edit&section=3 "Edit section's source code: Virtual levels")]


While skills cannot be leveled past 99, players sometimes use "virtual" levels to track their XP amounts beyond the level cap.

## Formula[[edit](/w/Experience?section=4&veaction=edit "Edit section: Formula") | [edit source](/w/Experience?action=edit&section=4 "Edit section's source code: Formula")]


The formula needed to calculate the amount of experience needed to reach level L is:



Experience=⌊14∑ℓ=1L−1⌊ℓ+300⋅2ℓ/7⌋⌋
If the floor functions are ignored, the resulting summation can be found in closed form to be:



Experience≈18(L2−L+6002L/7−21/721/7−1)
The approximation is very accurate, always being within 14 experience of the true value.


One final approximation is



Experience≈18(L2−L+6002L/7−21/721/7−1)−L10−γ=L28−940L+752L/7−21/721/7−1−γ
where γ is the [Euler–Mascheroni constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_constant). This approximation always gives an answer within 1 experience of the true value.



## Graphs[[edit](/w/Experience?section=5&veaction=edit "Edit section: Graphs") | [edit source](/w/Experience?action=edit&section=5 "Edit section's source code: Graphs")]


The experience required for each level can be graphed. Graphing the experience required on a linear scale shows that the experience required is essentially exponential.



[![](/images/thumb/Linear.png/500px-Linear.png?5fd2b)](/w/File:Linear.png)




Graphing the same data on a logarithmic scale shows that the function starts being exponential around level 15.

### "92 is half of 99" rule[[edit](/w/Experience?section=6&veaction=edit "Edit section: \"92 is half of 99\" rule") | [edit source](/w/Experience?action=edit&section=6 "Edit section's source code: \"92 is half of 99\" rule")]


Roughly after level 20, the experience required to reach 7 more levels in a skill is nearly the same amount of experience required to reach the current level of a skill, hence the total experience at level 92 being half of the total experience at level 99. 


This "X is half of X+7" rule becomes more accurate the higher the skill level is:
