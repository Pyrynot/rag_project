Models are trained on a specific set of data, and they have a knowledge cutoff date, so often they don't know specifics.

RAG, which stands for Retrieval, Augmentation, and Generation, can be quite helpful addressing this problem by inserting likely relevant, up-to-date text as context during inference time to go along with the question/instruction. It does this by storing the relevant documents in a vector database, and during inference time, querying it to find similar texts.

There are a lot of open-source libraries for this, which I'll probably be using, since this is only a 5-credit course. However, building my own framework could be an extremely rewarding experience, that no doubt would teach me a lot, and I could continue using and refining it for my personal projects. I might begin with building my own, and if that proves too challenging, switch to a library.

From the last project I learned that good planning is an important part of any project.
